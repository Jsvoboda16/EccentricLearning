Education is the foundation of a productive and successful society. Too often today is education ignored and not given the energy nor funding that is desperately needs to be successful. Here at Eccentric Learning, we strive to make education not only more available to eager learners but also a more individualized system to learners across the world. For the past four years, our team’s been researching and studying various forms of education and current systems that exist and many of the systems that exist not only don’t satisfy what education should achieve but also make education something that’s often dreaded by learners. Take a look at some of our team members below and how their efforts have helped build Eccentric Learning.

<p class="">Jeremy officially founded Eccentric Learning in the Spring of 2017 but it’s been in the works for quite some time. He’s been working on it for the past four years and it’s gradually evolved from an extremely rough concept to a working design for his view of the future of education. In 2013 he began his research on models of the current education system and over the course of the next couple of years noted many of the issues he found with them and slowly began working through each issue to make them better systems. In the spring of 2015 he took all the issues that he found solutions to and started working through each piece like a huge puzzle. This puzzle has been in the works since 2015 and finally in the spring of 2017 he had a functional model of his program and he hopes to have it integrated into schools in the fall of 2017.</p>
